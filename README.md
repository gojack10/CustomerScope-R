# CustomerScope: RFM Analytics & Strategic Segmentation

Welcome to the "CustomerScope: RFM Analytics & Strategic Segmentation" project. This project aims to perform customer segmentation for a marketing campaign by utilizing clustering algorithms to identify distinct groups based on purchasing behavior.

## Overview

This project involves analyzing customer purchasing behavior using the Online Retail Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The primary goal is to segment customers into distinct groups to tailor marketing strategies effectively.

## Key Tasks

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Utilize the Online Retail Dataset available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail).

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Develop Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values to capture customer purchasing behavior.

3. **Clustering**:
   - Implement K-means and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms.
   - Use the Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores to determine the optimal number of clusters.

4. **Analysis**:
   - Profile each customer segment.
   - Provide strategic recommendations tailored to each segment.

## Tools and Libraries

- **R**: The project is implemented in R, utilizing the following libraries:
  - `dplyr` for data manipulation.
  - `ggplot2` for data visualization.
  - `cluster` and `factoextra` for clustering and visualization.

- **RStudio**: The development environment used for this project.
